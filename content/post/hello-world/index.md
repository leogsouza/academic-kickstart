Hello Everyone, my name is Leonardo Souza and at the beginning of this year I decided to change my old website and create a blog to writing about anything that I wanted. 

## **Who am I?**

I am a self-taught Brazilian Software Developer that enjoys learning new things and sharing what I learn. I have over 14 years working in a variety of technologies and I am specialized in Backend and API Development a variety of technologies. I also have good experience with Frontend and a little bit with Mobile. When I am not coding, I usually spare my time with my family.

## **Why did I create this blog?**

Well, some reasons encouraged me to create this blog:
- I am studying English and I need to improve my skills to become fluent. So, I see that writing is a good way to improve them.
- I want to boost my coding skills and increase my knowledge in software development. And for me, writing could allow me to understand and explain with more details a specific subject and then master it (applying Feynman Technique).
- I also want to share my personal experiences that could be useful for anyone who's living a similar situation.

## **Conclusion**
So, this is my first post and I know that maybe I made some mistakes but I'll improve my writing skills as I write more and certainly give more interesting subjects.

Feel free to reach out with your thoughts.

Thank you!!
