I have over 15 years of experience working as a Software Developer and my biggest frustration it's that I don't have enough knowledge about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). So, to fix this, I decided (again) to start from beginning and study DSA improve my knowledge and feel better with myself. To help me to improve my knowledge I will write about every step that I will advance in this journey and share some material I will use to acomplish this goal.
